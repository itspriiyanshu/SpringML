# SpringML

This Repo consists of 3 submissions for ML Spring camp entry tasks.

Task 1: LatticePhysics
Regression task. Buit a neural network(64*32*16*2), implementing early stopping.
Target Variable:
Task 2: QuarksGluons
Classifier task. Implemented XGBoost Classifier, for faster computation on large dataset provided. Used AI to find its suitable hyperparams.

Task 3: SMILEmolecules
Regression task. Built a neural network(32*16*1), applied l2 regularisation & early stopping.Used ai to plot graphs.

AI use: To learn about models, For syntaxin, graph plotting, converting dataset to required format & error optimisations
